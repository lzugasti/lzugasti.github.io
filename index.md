Computer Science Technology, Won Award for highest overall average in the program. (RScore 36.7)

# Projects
### Vehicle Onboard Computer (ECU) modification:
* Using a bluetooth connection between the onboard vehicle's computer and an Arduino board, led lights throughout the car create a light show depending on the current speed.
* Coded in C/C++

### Operating System Simulation:
* OS does Round-Robin scheduling and simulates a kernel, shell, RAM and CPU.
* Coded in C

### MIPS Image Processing:
* Coded in MIPS
* Reads/Writes P2 and P5 PGM files from ASCII. Provides pixel access, contrast inversion and linear contrast stretching.

### A Few Games
* Galactic Snake (https://gitlab.com/ZugastLeo/ball-holes-games/) (Coded in JS, p5.js)
* Asteroid Drift (Coded in C#, Unity) - Learnt about Computer Graphics, Shaders, Collision Detection
* Sudoku Solver (https://gitlab.com/ZugastLeo/sudokusolver/)

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
