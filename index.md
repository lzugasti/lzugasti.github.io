### Ray Traced and Ray Marched rendering:
![Ray Tracing Image](/assets/img/10.png)
* Coded in OpenGL and C++
* Path Tracing used for rendering polygons
* Ray Marching used for rendering Metaballs (The weird jelly beans in the picture)

* Uses impulse to resolve collisions
* Voxels based approach to handle effect of explosions
* Coded in OpenGL and C++
  
### 

### MIPS Image Processing:
* Coded in MIPS
* Reads/Writes P2 and P5 PGM files from ASCII. Provides pixel access, contrast inversion and linear contrast stretching.

### Vehicle Onboard Computer (ECU) modification:
* Using a bluetooth connection between the onboard vehicle's computer and an Arduino board, led lights throughout the car create a light show depending on the current speed.
* Coded in C/C++

### A Few Games
* Galactic Snake [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ZugastLeo/ball-holes-games/) (Coded in JS, p5.js)
* Asteroid Drift (Coded in C#, Unity) - Learnt about Computer Graphics, Shaders, Collision Detection
* Sudoku Solver [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ZugastLeo/sudokusolver/)

### Operating System Simulation:
* OS does Round-Robin scheduling and simulates a kernel, shell, RAM and CPU.
* Coded in C
